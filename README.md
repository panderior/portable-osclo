This is the Andriod and Arduino source code for the Portable Oscilloscope project.
The goal of the project is to implement hardware to measure circuit voltages using Arduino and 
transmit the reading through wifi to an Andriod app which displays the voltage reading visually.

## Structure
The project has two main parts. The Arduino and Andriod developments. These are placed in their
respective folders.

## Circuit design
