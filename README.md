This is the Andriod and Arduino source code for the Portable Oscilloscoper project.
The goal of the project is to implement a hardware to measure circuit voltages using Arduino and 
transimt the reading through wifi to an Andriod app which display's the voltage reading visually.

## Structure
The project has two main parts. The Arduino and Andriod developments. These are placed in their
respective folders.

## Circuit deisgn
